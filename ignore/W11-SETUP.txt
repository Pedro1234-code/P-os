Privacy policy for the Windows 11 setup app


First of all, we do not colect any data and the application is completely offline (that means that the Microsoft Store version does not connect to any server)

The application is completely freeware and open-source. It does not contain any bloatware, spyware or malware that puts our users' data in risk
